## 1. Overview
This is a hand-motion controlled Flappy Bird game where the player controls the bird's movement to avoid pipes, with points awarded for passing through gaps, and the game ending if the bird collides with a pipe. The game is displayed on a VGA screen.

The idea is to design three main modules: OV7670, NN RGB, and Flappy Bird. The OV7670 module is responsible for gives data from the OV7670 camera, the NN RGB module is a neural network responsible for detecting skin color within a frame, then calculating the centroid of the hand and detecting whether the hand is moving vertically or horizontally. Finally, the Flappy Bird module creates the game logic and displays it on the VGA screen rely on the hand movement.

## 2. Ov7670
This module will process data from the camera in two steps:  
+ The first step sends the configuration set by the user to the camera via SCCB Interface, it is compatible with the I2C protocol.
+ The second step gets valid data based on the VGA frame timing and Horizontal timing.  

## 3. NN RGB
This module uses a neural network with 3 input nodes, 1 hidden layer with 7 nodes, and 2 output nodes. The input values will be the RGB values of each pixel, which will pass through a linear function to extract simple features. These will then pass through a nonlinear function (sigmoid) to extract more complex features. Finally, the output layer will determine whether the pixel is skin color or not.  

## 4. Flappy Bird
Hereâ€™s a summary of the mechanism of the Flappy Bird Logic:  
**Game Objective:** The player controls a bird that needs to avoid pipes. The bird's movement is controlled by hand gestures detected by a camera. The goal is to pass through gaps in the pipes without colliding with them.  

**Game Loop:** The bird continuously moves forward at a fixed speed. The player controls the bird's vertical movement by moving their hand up or down (detected via skin detection and centroid tracking).
Pipes are generated at random intervals and move from right to left across the screen.  

**Scoring:** Each time the bird successfully passes through a gap between pipes, the player earns one point.
The score increases as the bird progresses through the gaps.  

**Collision Detection:** The game checks if the bird collides with a pipe. If a collision happens, the game ends.  

**Game Over and Win Condition:** The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe.
The game can also have a win condition based on a preset score (e.g., 5 points), at which point a victory message is displayed (not yet).  

**Display:** The game is displayed on a VGA screen, with the bird, pipes, and score rendered based on hand movements.  

## 5. Addtional Features in The Future
**A low-pass filter** is used to process noise from the camera, as the current noise affects the NN RGB, causing errors in the centroid calculation of the hand.  

## 6. Problems  
During the production of this project, I encountered many problems, and in the end, there are a few key issues as follows:  

**P1:** The image quality from the camera was not as expected. To address this, I applied additional filters in the camera, but another issue occurs: the camera can not be used at night :joy::joy:.  

**P2:**
